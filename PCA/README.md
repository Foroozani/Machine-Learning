# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


The goal is to reduce the size (dimensionality) of a dataset while capturing most of its information.

There are many reason why dimensionality reduction can be useful:

 * it can reduce the computational cost when running learning algorithms,
 * decrease the storage space, and
 * may help with the so-called "curse of dimensionality."

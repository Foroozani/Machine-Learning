Machine-Learning, algorithm exapmles
-------------------------------------------------------------
1) Regularization and Overfitting Linear regression
   (Overfitting):
    A very common problem in machine learning
    When the model is much more complex than it should be (i.e. for using a lot of features)
        it may perform very well on the training data,
        but it performs very badly for new (unseen) data.
    In such situations, the model can not generalize well.


  (Regularization): An effective way to avoid (or at least to reduce) overfitting.

  2) Support Vector Machines 
   
  The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

  We can also use "GridSearch" method to improve the accuracy.

 3) K-Means algorithm 

K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that tries to cluster data based on their similarity. For this exaple, first we cleare an artificial data 
then we use scikit-learn library to cluster the data.

 4) Neural-Nets 

Keras Regession: In this example I use TF Regression and try to predict the house prices by using them. As you can guess, there are various methods to suceed this and each method has pros and cons.

The real data set can be found at Kaggle

There are also some code examples from ML course by Andrew NG.

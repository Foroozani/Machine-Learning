# 1) Regularization and Overfitting
   (Overfitting):

    A very common problem in machine learning
    When the model is much more complex than it shoud be (i.e. for using a lot of features)
        it may perform very well on the training data,
        but it performs very badly for new (unseen) data.
    In such situations, the model can not generalize well.

  (Regularization):
- An effective way to avoid (or at least to reduce) overfitting.

   The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

We can also use GridSearch to improve the accurace

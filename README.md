# Machine-Learning-   
Regularization and Overfitting
   (Overfitting):

    A very common problem in machine learning
    When the model is much more complex than it shoud be (i.e. for using a lot of features)
        it may perform very well on the training data,
        but it performs very badly for new (unseen) data.
    In such situations, the model can not generalize well.

  (Regularization):
- An effective way to avoid (or at least to reduce) overfitting.
